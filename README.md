# Remote control for Ets2

## Project Description
This project consists of a remote that let's you use a few extra buttons to control suspensions, axles and much more in the game Euro truck simulator 2 in a way to give you better access to these controls when you're using different peripherals like when using a wheel.
The design of this project was inspired by the remote made by Scania to control the air suspensions in their trucks shown in the image below.
